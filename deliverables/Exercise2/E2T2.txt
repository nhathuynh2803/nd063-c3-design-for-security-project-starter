Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
- None of the listed vulnerabilities appear to be directly related to the code deployed for the environment. 
  These findings point towards security configuration issues within the AWS environment itself.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- IAM.6Hardware MFA: Enabling hardware MFA for the root user is strongly recommended.
- IAM.9MFA: Enable software MFA for the root user as an alternative. 
- VPC Security Groups (EC2.2): Review and update VPC default security groups to only allow necessary inbound and outbound traffic for your application's functionality.
- CloudTrail.1: Enable CloudTrail and configure a multi-Region trail that logs read and write management events. This helps track user activity and potential security incidents.
- EC2.6: Enable VPC flow logging in all VPCs to monitor network traffic. This can provide valuable insights into potential security issues.
- IAM.11-17: Update your IAM password policy to enforce stricter password requirements. This includes requiring at least one uppercase letter, lowercase letter, symbol, number, a minimum length of 14 characters, and password rotation every 90 days or less.
